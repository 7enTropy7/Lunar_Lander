# Moon_Lander

This is a Deep Q Network that operates in the "LunarLander-v2" environment of OpenAI Gym. This is a simplified 2D version of the reusable rockets that are currently being developed by Elon Musk at SpaceX. 

On rendering the environment, you'll see the surface of the moon and a rocket falling from the top center part of the window. The rocket falls towards the Moon due to force of gravitation but to prevent it from crashing, it is equipped with 2 side thrusters and a main thruster. 

The target of the agent is to finely tune the 3 thrusters such that the rocket lands at the right spot on the Lunar surface (which is in between the 2 flags).
